# Are Humans Carnivores? Sorry, Vegans. Yes, They Are.

Similar to a high-performance vehicle, we’re designed for specific fuel to run properly.

That fuel is red meat. That’s why the carnivore diet is effective.

And this is important because the closer our diet is to what we’re evolutionarily adapted for, the healthier we’ll be.

Because hunter-gatherers were not brainwashed by the disastrous USDA recommendations, they ate what they were supposed to: red meat.

They were remarkably healthy as a result.

Studies of the remaining hunter-gatherer societies in the 1900s “showed them to be generally free of the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other so-called diseases of human civilization.”

I’m here to tell you that humans are carnivores and eating more meat will improve our health.

## What Is A Carnivore?

First off, what is a carnivore?

There are three types of carnivores:

1. Hyper Carnivore: Animal that obtains greater than 70% of calories from animal foods.
2. Obligate Carnivore: Animal that needs essential nutrients from animal foods for survival.
3. Facultative Carnivores: Animal that prioritizes animal foods but can eat vegetables for survival. (Brilliantly defined by Amber O’Hearn in her new book).

Humans are facultative carnivores.

Without consistent access to animal source foods, we would not have evolved into the dominant, blog reading, twitter trolling, and highly social primates that we are today. And now we require those nutrients.

The funny thing is that without eating animal source foods, we never even would have developed the capacity to question our diets and disparage meat in the first place.

It’s only because Ancel Keys ancestors ate and survived off of tremendous amounts of meat, that he was able to later sabotage meat.

Enough for my rant….

Here’s why humans are carnivores.

### Herbivore Ancestors & The High Fat Diet

Humans, the genus Homo, evolved from animals that consumed substantial amounts of plant foods. Our ancestors and the early great apes’ diets largely consisted of fibrous plants.

Many people mistakenly believe that we’re herbivores too because we evolved from these creatures.

In 1997, a number of researchers studied the diets of gorillas to better understand our dietary needs.

Gorillas, a herbivore species, consume a macronutrient profile that, at face value, looks like it largely consists of protein and carbohydrates.

![Gorilla diet showing its macros](image-link)

But when you account for the fiber digestion, it presents a completely different picture.

Out of every 100g of plant matter gorillas consume, about 74g is fiber.

Gorillas have large cecums and colons, which house bacteria that ferments the fiber into short-chain fatty acids.

When you account for this fermentation process, it turns out gorillas actually get 60-70% of their energy from fat.

Cows and other grazing animals all have a digestive system that utilizes a similar method.

According to Dr. Barry Groves cattle, sheep, goats, polar bears, and lions, actually all get the bulk of their energy from fat, despite their dietary intake differences.

The bacteria residing in these animals’ gut microbiome may be eating a high carbohydrate diet. But the animal is getting its energy from the fat that the bacteria produce from fiber.

## Are Humans Carnivores? How Humans Are Different

The distinguishing factor between humans and our primate ancestors is our brain size.

Not all of us were blessed with this adaptation…LOL.

Between 6 million and 2.5 million years ago, our brain size was fairly consistent. Since then, it has quadrupled in size.

![Human skeleton showing how our brains got bigger over the years](image-link)

According to Viljammur Stefansson in The Fat of the Land, the forest lands turned into dry prairies around 2 million years ago from climate change.

The pre hominid diet of fruits and seeds would no longer suffice. The cooler grasslands made plant foods more difficult to procure because of their seasonality.

Some pre hominids just turned to lower quality plant foods. To be fair, this was the easier approach and none of us are immune to this laziness. We’ve all scavenged the fridge for low-quality foods when we’re too lazy to shop for groceries.

But fossil evidence shows that by 1.2 million years ago, these ancestors of ours died out.

Other, let’s call it, more entrepreneurial hominids found new ways to survive and obtain sufficient energy.

These more enterprising humans started to hunt and scavenge for higher energy animal products.

“Increasing the consumption of animal foods could have allowed hominins to increase their body size without losing mobility, agility, or sociality.”

Their brains started to grow. In this period from ~1 million to 500,000 years ago is when a substantial part of our brain’s growth occurred.

But our brains are extraordinarily energy-intensive. They’re only 2% of our bodyweight, but they use up 20% of our resting energy.

According to anthropologists Leslie C. Aiello and Peter Wheeler, to provide enough energy to grow our brain, we had to give up something else.

![Graph comparing humans and other mammals on how we traded in our colon size to increase our brain size](image-link)

We traded in our colon size and our ability to ferment fiber into fat to increase our brain size. This gave our brains the necessary energy to grow.

“In this regard, hominids, like felines, have experienced a reduction in gut size and metabolic activity along with a concurrent expansion of brain size and metabolic activity as they included more and more energy-dense animal food into their diets.”

Our digestive system also adapted and is more similar to a wolf than it is to our herbivore ancestors.

We’re no longer adapted to digest substantial amounts of fibrous vegetables and starchy carbohydrates. This is a big reason why so many people have leaky gut and related health issues.

## Humans Needed Animal Foods for Energy

We needed more energy to fuel our increasingly large brains.

We could no longer get that energy from fiber because we couldn’t ferment it into fat. Our smaller colon prevented us from doing so.

During our evolutionary journey into the sapiens we are today, there were some plants growing here and there. But most were extremely fibrous and we couldn’t convert the fiber into fat for energy.

To make matters worse, there were around 500,000 years of ice age where plants did not consistently grow and we hadn’t yet invented fire.

We needed a consistent source of energy, which plant food couldn’t have provided without fire and a large colon.

The most available source of energy were gigantic animals – megafauna – that lived at the time. These animals’ fat fulfilled our energy needs without carbohydrates, fibrous vegetables, and overpriced smoothies at our disposal.

Productivity hacks aren’t just a modern phenomenon. Hunter-gatherers tended to eat more of the foods that provided a higher return of calories vs the time required to obtain the food.

The table below shows the energy yield of the different foods available. As you can see, the top 8 are all animals.

![Different energy yields of foods available](image-link)

Shockingly, they were able to accomplish this all without Adderall. They were instinctively attracted to higher energy foods.

Pine nuts, for example, provided less energy than a rabbit and frequently took longer to obtain. It was a total waste of time to spend the day searching for them.

Without the energy and nutrients from these fatty, gigantic animals, our brains would never have been able to grow 4x in size.

## Humans Needed Animal Foods for Brain Growth

The brain is an energy and nutrient-hungry organ. Without the nutrients provided by animal foods, our brain growth and intelligence could have never come to fruition.

With regards to the critical nutrients for your brain, animal source foods are the best and most bioavailable source for almost every single one.

As you can see below, Spinach, one of the vegetables thought to be most nutritious (thanks Popeye), is woefully deficient in most of the required nutrients for your brain.

Next to beef liver, spinach looks like cardboard!

![Spinach vs carnivore diet staples per 100 gram serving](image-link)

A study found that 47% of Vegans in Switzerland were deficient in Zinc, while only 10% of Omnivores were.

According to Katharine Milton:

“Without routine access to ASF, it is highly unlikely that evolving humans could have achieved their unusually large and complex brain while simultaneously continuing their evolutionary trajectory as large, active and highly social primates.”

Below are some of the main nutrients that are essential to brain health, that only animal source foods provide in sufficient quantities.

### DHA

DHA is one of the most critical for the brain. ⅔ of the brain is fat and 20% of that fat is DHA. Without it, the frontal cortex could not function and intelligence would likely be impossible.

DHA also is indispensable for all of the following functions:

- Blood barrier brain integrity
- Mitochondrial membranes
- Myelination
- Synapses
- Neural connectivity
- Cortical development

The problem is plant foods contain absolutely no DHA. They only contain ALA which is extremely difficult to transform to the DHA the brain needs.

No surprise, but Vegans and Vegetarians have lower DHA levels.

And I don’t think that our hunter gatherer ancestors were going to the nearby Whole Foods to pop an omega 3 pill.

Even calorically dense plant foods that we may have eaten do not contain the fatty acids necessary to propel our brain growth forward.

> “The only plant foods with sufficient caloric density to increase the DQ…would have been oily seeds or nuts. However, as shown in table 2, these plant foods contain no discernable amounts of either AA or DHA.”

Brain AA and DHA percentage makeup is fairly constant across mammals. But the brain cannot synthesize sufficient DHA endogenously. To grow, it needs a supply of exogenous DHA.

Without an animal source food to provide preformed DHA and AA, our brains wouldn’t have been able to grow.

In addition to fatty acids, the brain also needs vitamins and minerals to extract energy from ketones and glucose. Some of the most critical for brain functionality are the following:

#### Vitamin A
- One of, if not the most important vitamins. Regulates 500+ genes and stem cell differentiation.
- Abundant in beef liver and eggs in the preformed version that the body can use: retinol.
- Retinol is at least 21x more bioavailable than the plant Vitamin A carotenoids.

#### B Vitamins
- B vitamins are probably the most important vitamins for the brain. And most people are deficient today.
- B vitamins play an indispensable role converting fuel to energy. They also help create red blood cells that transport oxygen to the brain. Lastly, they affect mood by altering neurotransmitter function.
- B vitamin deficiencies have been linked to depression.
- For sufficient B vitamin intake, on a carnivore diet you should include beef liver.

#### Vitamin K2
- Regulates calcium in the bone and the brain.
- One study suggests that low vitamin K leads to some of the damage from Alzheimer’s.
- Another study assessed the vitamin K levels of early stage Alzheimer’s. They found that the patients had much less vitamin K intake than the control group.
- Vitamin K2 also can help prevent heart disease by directing calcium to bones instead of depositing them in the arteries.

#### Choline
- Choline helps produce key neurotransmitters that aid in focus and learning.
- Choline also helps maintain the structure of cell membranes, which is responsible for memory and mental clarity.
- Choline deficiencies can hurt concentration, memory and lead to cognitive impairment.
- Our bodies can make a small amount of choline, but we must obtain the rest from food. Beef liver is the best source.

#### Iron
- Helps cells generate energy, plays a crucial role in oxygen circulation throughout your body, and helps your immune system destroy harmful pathogens like bacteria and viruses. Beef liver is one of the best sources of iron in the world.

#### Copper
- Acts as a key to activate a number of enzymes which go on to regulate energy production, brain function, and iron metabolism.

#### Zinc
- Converts B6 to active form, aids in serotonin synthesis and dopamine transport. Animal products are the foods highest in zinc. Beef liver, nature’s multivitamin, is a great source.

#### Iodine
- Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. These hormones are critical for brain growth and development. Fish, salmon roe and eggs are good dietary sources of iodine.

## Humans are Made to Eat Meat
We evolved to require animal source foods.

Our bodies adapted to meat consumption, and we quickly became spoiled. Humans co-evolved eating meat and now are adapted to consume them.

Like a high-performance car, our digestive systems and brains need meat as fuel.

Cows eat grass. Tigers eat meat. And humans are carnivores.

Humans, like cows and tigers, cannot be nourished by any sort of food they put into their mouth.

Humans can only fully digest and optimally function on animal products. We are carnivores.

There is no such thing as an essential plant food or essential carbohydrate. Just essential nutrients. And they’re all in animal source foods.

## There Are No Essential Foods. Just Essential Nutrients
Our bodies cannot manufacture everything we require to function. We must get certain nutrients from food.

There are three macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. And there are four classes of micronutrients that are essential.

- Vitamins such as A, B, C, E, K
- Minerals such as Magnesium, Calcium, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sodium, Iodine
- Fatty Acids (Omega 3 and Omega 6)
- Amino Acids such as Isoleucine, leucine, etc.

So when we’re looking for healthy food, what we should be concerned with is nutrient density, energy supply, and any adverse side effects.

But we’ve been so thoroughly brainwashed by Ancel Keys and the USDA that everybody knows meat is unhealthy, especially compared to something like kale.

It turns out that red meat, one of the most feared foods, is the most bioavailable source of nutrients.

It contains all of the protein, nutrients and fat we need to function – in just the right proportions. Also, many of the nutrients in meat are easier to absorb than their counterparts in vegetables.

This isn’t a coincidence. It’s because humans are carnivores.

After spending millions of years adapting to animal consumption, our bodies now require it.

A properly constructed carnivore diet, consisting of beef steak, beef liver and eggs is 100% nutrient sufficient.

Animal products are the only sources where we can get all our macro and micronutrient needs. Vitamins A, B12, D and K2 — nutrients that we cannot function without — are not prevalent in sufficient amounts in plant foods.

Modern grains, on the other hand, don’t have enough of these nutrients. You’d have to eat 27,000 calories on a traditional diet to get nutritional requirements.

That’s a lot of Pringles.

## Other Evidence Humans Are Carnivores
### Weaning
Humans' large brain is key to our success. Psouni et al showed that diet is a key factor influencing time to weaning.

Early weaning is one of the main differentiating factors of the genus Homo from the great apes.

According to Psouni:

> “Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes.”

Early humans’ carnivorous diet changed our weaning behavior and the ultimate course of evolution

### Fat Cell Size
Pond and Mattacks studied fat cell size and structure in 200 mammals. Carnivores had more smaller fat cells. Omnivores had fewer large fat cells.

Humans' fat cells exhibited the carnivorous pattern. Pond and Mattacks concluded that;

> “These figures suggest that the energy metabolism of humans is adapted to a diet in which lipids and proteins rather than carbohydrates, make a major contribution to the energy supply.”

### Stomach Acidity
Stomach acidity protects against pathogens. Thus a higher acidity often indicates a diet high in bacteria.

The lower the pH, the higher the acidity. Carnivores' stomachs are more acidic than omnivores at 2.2, but less acidic than scavengers who have a pH of 1.3.

Humans have a stomach pH of 1.5, which indicates that our diets were likely high in scavenged food. We ate the food over several days and our high stomach acidity protected us against the rotting food.

### Shoulder Suited to Throwing vs Climbing
Humans are the only primate that regularly can throw with speed and accuracy. Darwin pointed out that this enabled humans to hunt with spears effectively.

Around 2 million years ago, humans adapted to elastically store energy in our shoulders and throw at high speeds. The chimpanzee’s shoulder on the other hand, is more adapted to climbing trees.

Not all of us our Nolan Ryan, but humans are unique in this ability. Coupled with the evidence around increased hunting that began 2 million years ago, the selection for throwing likely had a profound effect on evolution.

# Conclusion

Human beings are carnivores. We’ve adapted to require the nutrients meats require and survive off of meat alone.

The only reason we eat other food groups are because we’ve been brainwashed by money hungry nutritional agencies, or because we like the taste. We need animals to survive. We don’t need any other foods to.

Because of our millions of years of adapting to meat products, meat is the healthiest thing you can eat. Our health pales in comparison to carnivore tribes like the Masai.

The Mongol’s were a dominant force because they ate meat and their enemies did not.

Let’s adopt their mentality, eat what we’re made to, and dominate our opponents and life.
